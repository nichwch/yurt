Reality check: note taking apps are just note taking apps; it is supremely arrogant to think that you think you can replicate with a couple KLOCs of javascript code what took evolution thousands of years to perfect. I have stopped thinking about exegesis as a personal knowledge management system or a notetaking app. For me it is the mental equivalent of [perpetual stew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_stew) - I leave it on the stove and toss ideas in whenever its convenient. The effortlessness is the point; if I ever find myself drawing a diagram to have to figure out how to use it, that defeats the purpose of the whole thing.","parent":"posts/Second Brains-2-13-2021.txt","score":0.8604384165614133},{"content":"Why are so many tools for thought note taking apps?

So far,  our institutions and our tools have been designed for linear thought, not non-linear thought - not necessarily out of malice, but because our tools for organizing information (books) were stuck being linear for so long. As a result of this, non-linear thinkers have developed a kind of bad conscience - we view disorganized thinking as a problem to remedy. We build tools to rid ourselves of nonlinear thinking, never to embrace it.","parent":"posts/Why I made exegesis-2-28-2021.txt","score":0.8565771302975115},{"content":"That leads to a broader question: why is it that most [[tools for thought]] are also seen as \"note taking apps?\" The introduction of [[roam]] research has inspired a number of other products with the same core backlinking functionality - all of which bill themselves as both tools for thought and note taking apps. This implies that tools for thought and notetaking apps are synonymous, but nobody really thinks this; a decent amount of creators in the tools for thought space object to their creations being called \"note taking apps\", and even the ones who self-describe their projects as note taking apps insist that they're more than just that. This makes sense - the term \"[[tools for thought]]\" evokes something incredibly broad and ambitious, while note taking is a mundane (and arduous) activity. Indeed, it'd be a crying shame if tools for thought were limited to just note taking tools.","parent":"posts/On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity-8-27-2021.txt","score":0.8555138566793146},{"content":"Here's a mystery that's been on my mind for a while now: I never take notes in class, I never use [[exegesis]] to take notes, so how is it that I ended up making something that most people would classify as a \"note taking app\"?","parent":"posts/On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity-8-27-2021.txt","score":0.8552059083552082}]}
