Recollection is such a small, basic part of thinking! There is so much more to thinking than simply remembering something accurately. I think we can acknowledge the benefits these apps bring while also admitting that better tools for thought should help us do more with ideas than just remember and recall.\" [[quotes]] [[Linus Lee]] [[tools for thought]]","parent":"posts/On tools for thought: knowledge management vs creativity.txt","score":0.8332619443127668},{"content":"On the other hand, hypertext is built around the idea of a hyperlink, which is just a link from one document to another.
